                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <h4>Be clear about what you want the visitor to do</h4>
                    <p>For knowledge content you want the visitor to show interest by following you, commenting on the blog, book marking your blog page, and post your blog on their social media pages.  Do not overload the options, but you should in the text say things like, "check out the posting on XYZ on Facebook".  With the hyperlink attached as the call to action.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <h4>Be clear about what value you are providing</h4>
                    <p>In the first few sentences, say what they get for reading your blog entry.  For example a blog about configuring the SAP Project Information System, you would say in the first few sentences "The key fundamental steps to setting up the Project Info System"</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    <h4>Write in the Second Person Only</h4>
                        <p>You should never say "I", "me" etc.  Don’t tell your visitors what you’ve done or what you know. Tell them what <em>THEY will know or what THEY can do</em> </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    </h4>Have Structure through hierarchy levels, Do not just write like you write an email</h4>
                    <p>This is a must have.  You got to write by hierarchies.  For example this blog posting has the following hierarchy.    Effective Blog Writting>>>Blog Commandments for SEO Optimization>>>The listing of the 10 SEO Commandments>>></p>
                    <p>Think of it this way, you assign headings a ranking 1 through 6.  1 is level 1 - the blog title, 2 - is the blog value, 3 - Blog value another way, 4- The listing of the blog rules</p>
                    <p>If you were to just read the headings, you should get an overall summary of the blog (if the paragraph text is supressed)</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <h4>Only write what is necessary - avoid talking about unrelated stuff, this just confuses the search engines</h4>
                    <p>
                       Get rid of FLUFF, you are not writting like you do for a book, using metaphors or similar techniques, will just confuse the search engines.  Don't talk about kids, the beach when you are talking about business processes.
                    </p>
                        
                    <li>
                    <h4>Only Deliver a Single Point Per Blog, And use Repetition</h4>
                    <p>A blog should be about one specific thing or is a compliation blog (one that summarizes a bunch of other blog topics).  You want to say the point of the blog more than once, in a hierarchy fashion.  IF you just read the headings, you would know the point of the blog, if you read just the paragraph body you would also.</p></li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Visuals are a must.</h4>
                        <p>Don't just have text, include a picture, an info graphic, a chart, a table etc.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Write in a frienthy way, avoid the negative and avoid words that will get indexed as part of the blog but is not positive</h4>
                        <p>Try not to start each blog with a negative, then give the positive.  This is bad as you will really get indexed according to the negative thing over the positive thing.  The first half of the blog is much more important than the second half.  You got to start with the postitive.  if mentioning the negative, you can do so, but not in the order of negative to postitive.  Instead positive (with references to the past negative)</p>
                    </li>
